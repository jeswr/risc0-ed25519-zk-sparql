As a performance comparison, we evaluate these dataset and queries on Oxigraph outside of the RISC0 ZKVM environment.
On the MacOS local machine we found that the time to load and execute the query was between 0.15 - 0.25s for all datasets
and queries. Specifically for the 1-credential dataset, the SELECT ALL, Can Drive and Employment queries took 0.18s, 0.17s and 0.17s respectively;
and on the 4-credential dataset, the queries took 0.18, 0.23s and 0.17s respectively.

 0.1-2s for all minimal queries
and 

For those implementations of the interface in which
